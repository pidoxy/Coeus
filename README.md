# Coeus
Hacking 4 Community Hackathon

## Overview
With Coeus, you can practice avoiding memory loss problems, especially Alzheimer's, by helping using our application. The game is designed to entertain as well as serve its primary purpose of strengthening one's memory.

Built with HTML, CSS, bootstrap, javaScript, and firebase technologies are all used in the creation of Coeus. Figma was used to design UI

## How it was built
After exchanging ideas about how to implement the application, we decided to build it with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into
When we were four members of a team, we decided to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because it was the most popular stack amongst us all. However, some unplanned events led to some of our teammates leaving, causing a lot of work for the other three members. React js would have made work much but a lot had already been covered unfortunately

## What we learned

## No matter what project we're working on, always keep setbacks in mind
Be willing to learn new things.
In terms of design 80% of the expectations were executed but there was some element of design that could've been communicated more effectively.
Expect the unexpected
